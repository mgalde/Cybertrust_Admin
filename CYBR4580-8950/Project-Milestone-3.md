# Project realization Progress Report
## Overview
The Cybertrust team has finished work on the dashboard page within the cybertrust project. The team focused more on how to display useful data to the end user and to allow the end user to be informed from both large populations as well as small populations and be able to make informed decisions.

## Outcomes
* We not only have each user ranked by victimization risk but we can view data based on this as a filer
* We are able to present data by collected demographics as well to include age, sex, education and department once those fields are populated
* We have focused on showing all members of the population ranked by the users F1 score which was more useful to the end user.
* Most information happens within the same web view with no need to push additional information
* The team successfully utilized a technique to best display data based on true positive, false positive, true negative and false negative to the end user

## Hinderances
* Ember charts was looked to be replaces and while zingcharts looked to be the solution ember charts has a more active community
* The team has moved into two teams, one visualization and the other backend data. This has improved productivity but both teams need to communicate so that the process moves faster. We are on a schedule which is being met but the complexity between the two groups makes this slow moving.

## Milestone 3 product increments

* In this milestone the team focused on presenting the data best to the end user
* The team found backend data able to be manipulated to show user victimization possibilities useful to the end user


## Final code
* Final code is within Cybertrust repo under Capstone Project 2019
